# OBSS AI Challenge

This repository contains my solution for the **OBSS AI Image Captioning Challenge**, a multimodal deep learning competition organized as part of the OBSS AI Internship Program.

The task was to generate semantically accurate captions for images using large-scale vision-language models. Final evaluation was based on a custom embedding-based metric called **Fréchet GTE Distance (FGD)**.

## 📌 Project Overview

The objective was to build an end-to-end image captioning system capable of generating contextually relevant descriptions for 21,000+ images sourced from the Open Images dataset.

Unlike traditional lexical metrics (BLEU, ROUGE), this competition used a semantic evaluation metric based on embedding distributions, encouraging models to generate meaningfully aligned captions rather than surface-level text similarity.

## 🧠 Models Explored

During experimentation, the following multimodal architectures were trained and evaluated:

- **BLIP (Bootstrapped Language Image Pretraining)** – fine-tuned and selected as final model
- **CLIP-based approaches**
- **LLaVA (Large Language and Vision Assistant)**

Comparative benchmarking was performed to evaluate:

- Caption semantic coherence
- Generalization capability
- Performance under FGD metric

The final submission was generated using a fine-tuned **BLIP** model.

## 📊 Evaluation Metric – Fréchet GTE Distance (FGD)

The competition used a modified Fréchet distance computed over text embeddings generated by the **GTE-small** model.

Evaluation process:
1. Convert predicted and ground-truth captions into embedding vectors.
2. Compute mean and covariance of each distribution.
3. Calculate Fréchet distance between embedding distributions.

Lower FGD scores indicate better semantic alignment.

This required optimizing captions not only for fluency but for embedding-space similarity.
